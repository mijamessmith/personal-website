                I got started in software with the classic high school Java class that left me thinking I'd never code again. From there I followed my dreams
                became a professional pianist, earning a doctorate and a Carnegie Hall/Juilliard fellowship on the way.
                I started getting back into code when I started learning Max/MSP in graduate school, a multimedia visual programing interface
                that allowed me to build audio processors for my own live playing. I couldn't shake the itch and started learning fullstack technologies on the side.
